# Amazon Clone - Group Project

## 📖 Project Description
We are a group of Bachelor of Engineering students specializing in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from Chitkara University, Punjab, Rajpura, India. Currently, we are in our Semester 2 and have created this project as part of our group work. The members of the group are:

- Samanyu Gautam
- Tanisha Garg
- Yashita Bansal
- Palak Bisht

## 🚀 About The Project
This project is an Amazon Clone built using HTML, CSS, and Flask. The primary focus of the project is the Flask backend development, where we have implemented several important features such as:

- App Routing
- Rendering Templates
- Redirect URLs for login pages
- Permanent and Temporary Sessions
- Database Integration

The main aim of this project was to replicate the structure and functionality of Amazon’s website as closely as possible, specifically the e-commerce pages, login pages, and user sessions.

## 💻 Technologies Used
The technologies used for developing this Amazon clone are:

- **HTML** – For building the structure and layout of the pages.
- **CSS** – For styling and creating responsive web pages.
- **Flask** – For the backend development, including routing, sessions, database handling, and more.

We have also set up the entire project on a Python Virtual Environment, ensuring that all dependencies are contained and easily manageable.

## 🔧 Key Features
- **Homepage** – The landing page that mimics Amazon's interface.
- **Login & Registration Pages** – User login and registration functionality with session management.
- **Product Pages** – A catalog-like page to display products.
- **Cart and Checkout** – An implementation of a shopping cart and checkout process.
- **Database Integration** – Storing user details, product data, and session management.

## 🛠️ Flask Features
In the backend, we’ve utilized Flask for:

- **Routing**: The app is divided into different routes for homepage, login, product display, etc.
- **Session Management**: We handle temporary and permanent user sessions, allowing users to stay logged in.
- **Database**: A simple database for storing user information, cart data, etc.

## 🌐 How to Access
The code for this project is publicly available on GitHub. You can clone the repository or view the code and documentation as needed.

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment.
3. Install required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the app with `python app.py`.

## 💡 Future Improvements
While we’ve managed to create a close replica of the Amazon website, some areas for future improvement include:

- Enhancing the product search and filter functionality.
- Implementing payment gateway integration.
- Improving the UI/UX design to make it more responsive and polished.
